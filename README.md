## Motivation </br>
Every student besides having a lot of opportunities faces a lot of trouble because of the lack of information and eventually not able to grab all the opportunities. Taking note of all off-campus drives, upcoming contest, and placement related information of the Institute is very hectic and not possible for everyone. Here we came up with a solution that is OneSTOP a one stop solution for every college student. This website automatically fetches data from different coding platforms and you get a compiled information from different coding platforms and MNCs website for off campus placement. You can also set reminders so that you can get every important notification for you. Now there is no need of feeling any burden because OneSTOP is here to help you out and keep you winning.
